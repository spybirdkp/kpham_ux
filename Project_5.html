							<h1>Netskope - Data Dashboard</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/05_Proj_5_imgs/00_Proj_5_img.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>Design Overview : Designing with Data</strong>
								<br>
								Designing with Data can be a huge challenge, especially if there is a large number of users 
								that is involved in a lot of activity. How can we effectively monitor our users to make sure 
								what they are doing is safe for the work environment. Are we sharing the right files and is it 
								infecting our system? We need to look at all the ways users interact within the organization by 
								how they are handling their data, whether its sharing, downloading, viewing, or transferring data 
								over the cloud. By looks at each activity and find common patterns, administrators and users who 
								oversee the organization can get a better grasp on how to identify the problem. </p>

							<p><strong>The goal of the project</strong>
								<br>
								To create a Dashboard where users can view overall data based on user activity.
								</p>

								<p><strong>Who is the client?</strong>
									<br>
									
							• Third party stakeholders and the employees within the organization.
									</p>

									<p><strong>What I'm trying to solve</strong>
										<br>
										• Create a cohesive Dashboard so the administrator can see all activities
										<br>
• Quickly view incident by look at data module
<br>
• Give users the option to customize their data priority
<br>
• Have a simple easy to understand graph for quantitative information.
										</p>

										<p><strong>Defining the Problem</strong>
											<br>
											• The main problem I will be addressing is lack of security and potential risks. 
											<br>
• What are the user needs based on my organization? 
<br>
• How much data do I need to translate? 
<br>
• What are the categories thats involved when downloading data?
<br>
• How safe is it to use this service over the cloud?
<br>
• Is it safe for my organization to continue to use this service?
											</p>

											<p><strong>Main Dashboard</strong>
												<br>
												In the main dashboard, the person can get a clear overview on each category and see the data quickly form a glance. 
												The data and numbers help give the individual a clear estimate on the overall activities of the organization in terms 
												of DLP violations, sites visited, files downloaded, and identifying users and groups with certain activity. I use the 
												massive data I gathered and tried to simplify the data in a way thats easy to understand. </p>

								<strong>Customizing the Dashboard</strong>
							<p>
								Users are able to experiment and try out different graphs either within launching or opening the widget library. 
								The UI library gives users the customizability in how they want to see their data. Do they prefer a bar graph or 
								circle? Maybe they just want to view specific users and numbers. By picking a graph, users are able to customize 
								and input the data that is important them to view. They can also save different dashboard sessions by making new 
								tabs for specific audiences the like to view.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/05_Proj_5_imgs/04_Proj_5_img.png" alt="" /></span>

								<strong>Research Questions for the app</strong>
								<p>

									To understand how does the overall dashboard functions, we need to understamd certain categories and questions. 
									What does the app do and what is its capability? I feel answering those questions and researching further into 
									data loss and protection will give me a better insight in understanding which information is important for users.</p>

<span class="image main"><img src="images/05_Proj_5_imgs/05_Proj_5_img.png" alt="" /></span>

<strong>Configure Settings</strong>
								<p>
									This customization helps users to report which problems users come across and you can easily switch on and off 
									if you want to enable certain actions on your users. Enabling the switch helps monitor how users are interacting 
									with the organization over the cloud.
								</p>

<span class="image main"><img src="images/05_Proj_5_imgs/06_Proj_5_img.png" alt="" /></span>

<strong>Filtering UI Patterns</strong>
								<p>

									The filtering patterns helps to easy filter by specific activity, so if there is something you don’t see on the keyboard. 
									You can use the filter ui to narrow your findings on the data you are looking for.</p>

										 <span class="image main"><img src="images/05_Proj_5_imgs/07_Proj_5_img.png" alt="" /></span>

										 <strong>Detailed Page for Incidents</strong>
								<p>

									Its great when you are able to see the overall view of information. But sometimes, we need to dive deeper after we look at the 
									general overall data. Which file is infecting and causing problems for users over the cloud? Where did it come from and whats 
									the source? By homing into the exact problem, we are able to see what viruses capabilities are, the users infected, and location 
									it come from. Knowing as much information on a particular incidents gives our users the ability to focus on several areas of the problem.
									</p>

									<strong>Reflections</strong>
								<p>

									It was a huge challenge working with a huge amount of data from users of many different companies. Who have to look at the different 
									behaviors and personality of each group cause not everyone is the same. Each administrator deals with their own set of challenges, so 
									providing data in a way thats quick at a glace and giving them the information they need most empowers them to do their jobs better. 
									Designing the graph along with the settings to filter out incidents has been a complex problem. After doing more user research and testing, 
									I slowly figure out the trends in what the  stakeholders were looking for in terms of information when viewing the graph.</p>
