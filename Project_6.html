							<h1>Cisco - Admin Data Dashboard</h1>

							<p><strong>Design Overview : Data Visualization Refresh</strong>
								<br>

Designing with Data can be a huge challenge, especially if there is a large number of users that is involved in a lot of activity. 
How can we effectively monitor our users to make sure what they are doing is safe for the work environment. Are we sharing the right 
files and is it infecting our system? We need to look at all the ways users interact within the organization by how they are handling 
their data, whether its sharing, downloading, viewing, or transferring data over the cloud. By looks at each activity and find common 
patterns, administrators and users who oversee the organization can get a better grasp on how to identify the problem. 
<br>
<br>

<strong>The goal of the project</strong>
<br>
To enhance the visual design of the current Dashboard and make it more modern.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Who is the client?</strong>
<br>
• Internal Cisco employees and third party stakeholders.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Enhancing the Design</strong>
<br>
• Using clear visuals and colors to meet accessibility standards
<br>
• Design with a modern look and feel with sleed UI
<br>
• Have a strong contrast of colors between UI
<br>
• Define visual hierarchy between space and information
<br>
• Have a clear typography between visual elements
<br>
• Have raw data become more visual and simplified to read.</p>

							<strong>Explore/Research: Choosing the Best Data Approach</strong>
							<br>
							<br>
							<p>
								<strong>Early considerations of data</strong>
								<br>
• Is the data fluid or static?
<br>
• How easily can the audience access your work – mobile/desktop/print?
<br>
• Can the visualisation be interactive?
<br>
• Does the data need cleaning?
<br>
<br>

<strong>Key questions for core users</strong>
<br>
• What do they actually want to know?
<br>
• What is their level of expertise/experience?
<br>
• What is likely to be well received? 
<br>
• Will the audience want to drill down into the data, for detailed page view?
<br>
• How often will it be viewed?
<br>
<br>
 
<strong>Which chart and when?</strong>
<br>
• A vs B = bar chart 
<br>
• Composition = pie, tree map, 100% stacked bar
<br>
• Trends over time = line graph
<br>
• Relationship between A and B = scatter graph
<br>
• Data distribution = box and whiskers/histogram
<br>
• Flow of source to destination = chord/snakey chart
<br>
• Contribution to total = waterfall 
<br>
• Placed data = map</p>

							<strong>A/B testing: Narrowing down graphs</strong>
							<br>
							<p>
								Between two graphs, they use the same data. We have two graphs. By trying out different graphs, 
								we are able to determine what works and what does not. The top example is hard to grasp a clear overview, 
								while the 2nd chart that uses the same data is much more clear.
								<br>
								<br>
								
								• Want to choose a graph thats easier to work with.
								<br>
								• Easier to compare data side by side
								<br>
								• Clear contrast and articulation of numbers
								<br>
								• Be fast to read and informative
								<br>
								• Audience can glance quickly of needed data</p>
								<br>

							<strong>Experimenting with Color & Space</strong>
							<p>
								The main problem I will be addressing is lack of security and potential risks. 
What are the user needs based on my organization? 
How much data do I need to translate? 
What are the categories thats involved when downloading data?
How safe is it to use this service over the cloud?
Is it safe for my organization to continue to use this service?

</p>

							<strong>Dark UI & Updated Modules</strong>
							<p>
								Overall enhancement on a Dark UI theme look and feel while using new graphs and charts for a refreshed look. 
								This is to help with the color contrast and easily spot information for the user if they choose to go for this option.

<br>
<br>
								 <strong>Overview landing page</strong>
								 <br>
								• This is the first menu an admin encounters upon login to Dashboard
								<br>
								• Provides a summary of the **** Services provisioned for this organization
								<br>
								• Cards for each Service: Message, Meeting, Calling, Care, Room Devices, and hybrid services
								<br>
								• Hybrid Services configured and a quick summary of their status
								<br>
								• Notifications of actions required
								<br>
								<br>

								<strong>Features & Functions</strong>
								<br>
• Calling Space (during meetings)
<br>
• Hybrid Services
<br>
• Onboarding
<br>
• Configuration & Provisioning
<br>
• Operations & Administration 
<br>
• Reporting & Analytics
<br>
• Users, Devices, Services, and Policies
<br>
• Complete your setup
</p>

<span class="image main"><img src="images/06_Proj_6G_imgs/03_Proj_6G_img.png" alt="" /></span>

								<strong>Troubleshooting Reports</strong> 
								<br>

								• Reports include
								<br>
								• Participant join meeting time, audio and
								video usage.
								<br>
								• Visual indicators of qualify for join meet time, audio, and video
								<br>
								• Host and presenter indicators
								<br>
								• Web client VoIP call quality, OS and
								browser version
								<br>
								• Dial in and call back call quality
								<br>
								• Usage of all clients
								<br>
								• Client IP address and location

								<strong>Light Dashboard with Refresh Graphs</strong>
							<p>
								The light version uses a module based approach on information. The light colors are to help balance 
								all the different colors and give room to clearly articulate the data and the numbers.

								<strong>Reflection and Insight</strong>
								<br>
<br>
<strong>Things I learned when working with Data:</strong>
<br>
• Less is more
<br>
• Don’t overload users
<br>
• Only show/highlight where action can be taken as a result of the data
<br>
• Use titles for graphs and tables – intelligent titles which tell the reader how to interpret it.
<br>
• Annotations can really reinforce a visualisation if the user isn’t that invested or interested.
<br>
• Tell a story with the data (what can be done about this)
<br>
• Be consistent in approach/data sets etc 
<br>
• Use the same/similar colours and layouts making it faster for users to navigate
<br>
• Use colour sparingly 
<br>
<br>

In conclusion, in order to have a good dashboard and graph, it’s best to always be as simple as possible. 
Know what information the customers need to see first and eliminate any other infomation that causes noise. 
The most important data should always show first and it should be a graph where it is easy to understand by 
most users and also be the most visible. It’s also important how numbers are displayed right next to the graph 
since having a lot of elements make it hard to see in a cluster of data. By having different module sizes, users 
can easily distinguish whats important. Have the color contrast of the graph and number plays a key role in knowing 
what data your viewing is important.</p>
